# 100-days-of-python
A repo of the mini projects I've made from Dr. Angela Yu's course "[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)" on Udemy <br>
<br>
Finished the begginer projects (days 01 to 14)<br>
**This is where the fun begins**<br>

My favorites so far are the Blackjack game from day 11<br>

And the Hangman game from day 07<br>
