# 100-days-of-python
A repo of the mini projects I've made from Dr. Angela Yu's course "[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)" on Udemy. <br>
Finished the begginer projects (days 01 to 14)<br>

My favorites so far are:<br>
<br>
The Pong game from day 22<br>
